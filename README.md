Wes McElroy Portfolio Site

I created this website, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, because I wanted
to display my portfolio and provide another example of my skills as a developer. I
made it unique by adding an image of myself that was originally black and white, but
that I changed to correspond to the colors of the site.
